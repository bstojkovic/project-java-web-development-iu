## 22.2.2026.
* Googled React.js installation instructions
* Encountered a design decision on how to create React app, that will be outlined in [design notes](./design-notes.md)

## 24.2.2026.
* Continued reading React.js installation instructions
* Encountered a design decision on which tool to use to actually build React app, that will be outlined in [design notes](./design-notes.md)
  * Chose to try using Vite

## 25.2.2026.
* React.js installation instructions via Vite shows a command to be ran in order to build a React scaffold, which I ran (`npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts`)
  * For framework, I chose React, and for variant I chose TypeScript because I want to learn more about static typing and the benefits it comes with
* After installation, I visited localhost and confirmed the Vite + React skeleton is running in the browser, satisfying iteration 0.1 criteria
