# Full-stack framework vs creating a React.js application from scratch
For creating a React.js application, a choice is presented: pick a full-stack framework, or build React app from scratch.

Since my design choice from Phase 1 was to use a FARM stack, using a full-stack framework might be too much overhead as I will be building Python + FastAPI server anyways, and connecting those might prove troublesome.

On the other hand, choosing a pre-made full-stack framework build could be an easier choice in the beginning.
However, I am not sure how hard it is to connect it to my backend.

With this in mind, I am going to go with the latter - building a React app from scratch.
This not only provides a learning opportunity on how a React app is built, but also leaves room for falling back to a framework if needed.
